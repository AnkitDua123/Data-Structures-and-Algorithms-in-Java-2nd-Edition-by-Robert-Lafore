# Maximum Element
### Problem from Hackerrank Practice > DataStructures > Stacks

You have an empty sequence, and you will be given **N** queries. Each query is one of these three types:

- 1 x  -Push the element x into the stack.
- 2    -Delete the element present at the top of the stack.
- 3    -Print the maximum element in the stack.

The first line of input contains an integer, **N** . The next **N** lines each contain an above mentioned query. (It is guaranteed that each query is valid.)

## Example:
### Input:<br>
10<br>
1 97<br>
2<br>
1 20<br>
2<br>
1 26<br>
1 20<br>
2<br>
3<br>
1 91<br>
3<br>

### Output:<br>
26<br>
91<br>
